          Finally I was able to quiet food noise !! I started Mounjaro at a dose of 2.5 mg, increased to 5.0 mg 
          after 4 weeks, and reached 7.5 mg after 16 weeks, achieving my target weight of 66 kg (145.5 lb). 
          Naturally, my food intake reduced without discomfort, making the diet process effortless and successful.

        <h3 class="serif">Lose up to 25% body weight</h3>
        <p>Mounjaro has been found to be very effective at supporting substantial weight loss. Clinical trials show 1 in
        3 people using Mounjaro 10mg or 15mg can lose up to 25% of their body weight. The studies also found that
        Mounjaro works best when used alongside changes to diet and increased physical exercise.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="serif">The science behind <i>Mounjaro</i></h2>
      <p>Mounjaro works by activating receptors of 2 hormones in the body, called GLP-1 and GIP receptors, which are mainly found in the pancreas, brain, stomach, and other organs.</p>
      <p>Mounjaro works in multiple ways. It helps:
        <ul>
          <li>The body release insulin when blood sugar is high.</li>
          <li>The body remove excess sugar from the blood.</li>
          <li>Stop the liver from making and releasing too much sugar.</li>
          <li>Reduce how much food is eaten.</li>
          <li>Slow down how quickly food leaves the stomach. This lessens over time.</li>
      </ul></p>
